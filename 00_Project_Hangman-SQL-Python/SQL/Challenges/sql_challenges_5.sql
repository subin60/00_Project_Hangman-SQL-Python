In SQL we can have many databases, they will show up in the schemas list
We must first define which database we will be working with. */

/* 1. Select all books from the table title that contain the word "cooking"
   in its title */

select title
from titles
where title like '%Cooking%';


-- 2. Select all titles that start with the word "The"

select title
from titles
where title like 'the%';


/* 3. Select the full names (first and last name) of authors whose last name
   starts with "S" */

select au_fname, au_lname
from authors
where au_lname like 's%';


/* 4. Select the name and address of all stores located in an Avenue
   (its address ends with "Ave.") */

select stor_name, stor_address 
from stores
where stor_address  like '%Ave.%';


/* 5. Select the name and address of all stores located in an Avenue or in a
   Street (address ended in "St.") */

select stor_name, stor_address

where stor_address  like '%Ave.%' or stor_address  like '%St.%';



/* 6. Look at the "employee" table (select all columns to explore the raw data):
   Find a pattern that reveals whether an employee is Female or Male.
   Select all female employees. */


select *
from employee
where emp_id like '%F';


/* 7. Select the first and last names of all male employees whose name starts
   with "P". */

select fname, lname
from employee
where emp_id like '%M' and fname like 'P%';


/* 8. Select all books that have an "ing" in the title, with at least 4 other
   characters preceding it. For example, 'cooking' has 4 characters before the
   'ing', so this should be included; 'sewing' has only 3 characters before the
   'ing', so this shouldn't be included. */

select title
from titles
where title like '%____ing%';
